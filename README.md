Dear Professor, This repository contains the coding implementation of my project, "Spam Detection in Emails Using RNN with Attention Mechanism." I have added two Google Colab Notebook copies to this repository. One is for the Assassin dataset as "NLP Project (Assasin).ipynb," and another one is for the TREC dataset as "NLP Project (TREC).ipynb." You can view the notebooks with outputs here. Also, you can view the Notebooks in Google Colab since I have also added the link to Colab.

To replicate the environment of my implementations, first, make a copy of each Google Colab Notebook. Then, download the dataset from the corresponding reference website mentioned in the paper. 

For example, if you want to run the model on the TREC dataset, go to the link "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bayes2003/emails-for-spam-or-ham-classification-trec-2007". Then, download the dataset and unzip it. Then, upload the "email_origin.csv" file to the Google Colab environment and run the Notebook you copied.

You can also run the model on the Assassin dataset similarly. I have added a direct link for each dataset in the report under the reference section.

 Thank you in advance.
